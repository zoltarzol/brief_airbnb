My favorite seven lovely logics:

1. Make Peace with your Past so it doesn’t spoil your Present.
2. What others Think of you is None of your Business.
3. Time Heals Almost Everything, Give the Time, Some Time.
4. No one is the Reason of your Happiness Except You yourself.
5. Don’t compare your Life with others, You have No Idea what their journey is all about.

Ik ben een gepassioneerde en gedreven violiste met heel wat eigen solistische en kamermuzische projecten naast mijn vaste plaats in de Opera.  Mijn hobby is mijn beroep en mijn beroep mijn hobby. Sinds 2019 studeer ik er nog een Bachelor Jazz bij. Naast muziek hou ik van alle vormen van kunst alsook de kunst van het leven zelf. Mijn twee zonen, (de ene zoon werkt aan een Phd en de andere zoon maakt deel uit van een zelfstandig verpleegkundig team), zijn beiden ook muzikaal begaafd, zij spelen gitaar en piano. In december trouwde ik voor de tweede maal met een topman. Hij werkt in het staf team van Stad Gent, departement opvoeding, jeugd en onderwijs. Hij heeft een passie voor lekkere wijn, creatief koken, reizen en het is zalig leven met hem. Vijf dingen waar ik niet buiten kan: mijn kinderen, mijn man, familie, ouders, mijn viool, muziek in het algemeen, mijn huis dat volledig verbouwd is naar eigen smaak en onze ""tempel"" is waar we ons gelukkig voelen, mijn vrienden en sociale contacten, mijn computer. Mijn favoriete reisbestemmingen zijn  Schotland, Zwitserland, Frankrijk, Engeland, Zuid-Korea, Tenerife, Spanje. Ik hou van boeken over psychologie, boeken over muziek en kunst. Favoriete films zijn alle films van Lars von Trier, Andrej Tarkovski, ""de andere film"" in het algemeen, maar ik hou ook van James Bond films en ""gemakkelijkere"" films. Ik hou van Koreaans eten, van de Franse keuken, Italiaanse keuken, de goeie Belgische keuken en van alle lekkere gerechten die met liefde klaargemaakt zijn.

I'm Barbara, a 40 year old local Ghentian crazy about chocolate and pilates! Friends describe me as 'Audrey Hepburn meets bubblegum'! I kinda think this explains it all! ;) 

I host a beautiful house called Sint-Ivo in the historical city center of Ghent. 

The house dates from the 14th century. It was originally called 'The Cogghe' - a referral to the ships that cruised the river. In 1748 the lawyers association together with doorkeepers and prosecutors settled into the house and named it Saint Ivo - lawyer of the poor in the 13th century.

At this point I have expanded the business to the point that we follow up on the entire chain from coffee tree to cup. I’m spending a lot of time in Colombia, where I visit local farmers in order to get the best coffee for the coffee bar. 
I used to travel quite adventurously myself. I still cherish these memorable moments of spontaneous hospitality and I take this as starting point to treat my guests.

Mijn passie voor koffie en hospitality vraagt het grootste deel van mijn tijd, daarnaast ga ik graag sporten, lezen en motorijden. Ik heb enkele avontuurlijke reizen gedaan, en de reismicrobe heeft me nog steeds niet losgelaten. Intussen spendeer ik veel tijd in Colombia, om daar “Direct Trade” koffie te zoeken. Door goede banden op te bouwen met lokale boeren, kan ik de lekkerste koffies importeren voor de koffiebar.

Born and raised in Moorslede and Bruges, we studied in Ghent and in Brussels. We fell in love and decided to settle in the beautiful city of Ghent. Whilst looking for a place to live, we bumped into what could be considered as one of the most centralised houses of Ghent. The house was old, dark and didn’t catch a lot of sunlight, but we saw a lot of possibilities to transform it into a little paradise in the ancient centre, close to all the hip and trendy places this city has to offer. As we travel a lot ourselves, we think we know what it takes to have a pleasant stay and discovering new cities and countries. We transformed the house in an ideal place for friends and guests visiting Ghent. By the summer of 2020 the house was finished.   
We hope you enjoy it as much as we do.

I’m spending a great deal of my time on my passion for coffee and hospitality. Doing sports, traveling, reading and riding my motorbike are some other things I love. 
At this point I have expanded the business to the point that we follow up on the entire chain from coffee tree to cup. I’m spending a lot of time in Colombia, where I visit local farmers in order to get the best coffee for the coffee bar. 
I used to travel quite adventurously myself. I still cherish these memorable moments of spontaneous hospitality and I take this as starting point to treat my guests.

Na een academische carrière en jaren in het onderwijs, ben ik sinds 2011 de trotse eigenaar van het koffiehuis “Café Labath” te Gent. 
Mijn passie voor koffie en hospitality vraagt het grootste deel van mijn tijd, daarnaast ga ik graag sporten, lezen en motorijden. Ik heb enkele avontuurlijke reizen gedaan, en de reismicrobe heeft me nog steeds niet losgelaten. Intussen spendeer ik veel tijd in Colombia, om daar “Direct Trade” koffie te zoeken. Door goede banden op te bouwen met lokale boeren, kan ik de lekkerste koffies importeren voor de koffiebar.

When looking for dates to book, might be a good idea to look up agelandkaai online, (our landcode is be), and have a look there, you'll find special offers on restaurants, the parking policy and other extra's, like our walking tours through Gent, and what we offer on food and drinks.

I’m spending a great deal of my time on my passion for coffee and hospitality. Doing sports, traveling, reading and riding my motorbike are some other things I love. 
At this point I have expanded the business to the point that we follow up on the entire chain from coffee tree to cup. I’m spending a lot of time in Colombia, where I visit local farmers in order to get the best coffee for the coffee bar. 
I used to travel quite adventurously myself. I still cherish these memorable moments of spontaneous hospitality and I take this as starting point to treat my guests.

Na een academische carrière en jaren in het onderwijs, ben ik sinds 2011 de trotse eigenaar van het koffiehuis “Café Labath” te Gent. 
Mijn passie voor koffie en hospitality vraagt het grootste deel van mijn tijd, daarnaast ga ik graag sporten, lezen en motorijden. Ik heb enkele avontuurlijke reizen gedaan, en de reismicrobe heeft me nog steeds niet losgelaten. Intussen spendeer ik veel tijd in Colombia, om daar “Direct Trade” koffie te zoeken. Door goede banden op te bouwen met lokale boeren, kan ik de lekkerste koffies importeren voor de koffiebar.
De memorabele momenten van spontane gastvrijheid op mijn reizen koester ik nog steeds. Die gastvrijheid heb ik steeds zelf voor ogen bij het ontvangen van mijn gasten.

At this point I have expanded the business to the point that we follow up on the entire chain from coffee tree to cup. I’m spending a lot of time in Colombia, where I visit local farmers in order to get the best coffee for the coffee bar. 
I used to travel quite adventurously myself. I still cherish these memorable moments of spontaneous hospitality and I take this as starting point to treat my guests.

Na een academische carrière en jaren in het onderwijs, ben ik sinds 2011 de trotse eigenaar van het koffiehuis “Café Labath” te Gent. 
Mijn passie voor koffie en hospitality vraagt het grootste deel van mijn tijd, daarnaast ga ik graag sporten, lezen en motorijden. Ik heb enkele avontuurlijke reizen gedaan, en de reismicrobe heeft me nog steeds niet losgelaten. Intussen spendeer ik veel tijd in Colombia, om daar “Direct Trade” koffie te zoeken. Door goede banden op te bouwen met lokale boeren, kan ik de lekkerste koffies importeren voor de koffiebar.
De memorabele momenten van spontane gastvrijheid op mijn reizen koester ik nog steeds. Die gastvrijheid heb ik steeds zelf voor ogen bij het ontvangen van mijn gasten.

We are expats who divide their time between two lovely cities: Uppsala (Sweden) and Ghent. When we are away, we decided to share our house with other travelers, who can enjoy a restful stay in the quiet suburbs and combine it with visiting the beautiful city of Ghent.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />The house has a spacious living room with dining table and a seating area. There are two bedrooms, each of them has a double bed. The bathroom has a bathtub and a shower. Of course, we also have a washing machine, as we know that traveling with kids sometimes involves a lot of laundry. Because we are a family with small kids, we have almost everything for little ones. There are toys, books (mostly in Dutch and Swedish), a baby chair, toddler bed and baby cot<br /><br /><b>Other things to note</b><br />The garden is a great area to play in, but because we are often away, it sometimes can look a bit like a jungle. Feel free to roam around,","Within walking distance from our house, you can find a supermarket (Carrefour), a bakery and a butcher. If you like to be outdoors, we can recommend the nature park “Bourgoyen-Ossemeersen”, which is only 1,5 km away and is nice green spot to relax. If you are by bike, it only takes about 15 minutes to go to the city center, there are lots of cycling routes to choose from. Or you can go to the nearest bus stop (100m) or the tram stop (1,2 km)",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/eb6a39f3-066f-4cbc-a507-465df5bfa030.jpg,264225624,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/264225624,Femke,2019-05-26,,"",within a few hours,80%,90%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/9a5c83bb-f09c-4c71-a5e1-f31d0f62b49f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/9a5c83bb-f09c-4c71-a5e1-f31d0f62b49f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,1,1,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Gent, Vlaanderen, Belgium",Mariakerke,,51.07711,3.68775,Entire bungalow,Entire home/apt,4,,1 bath,2,2,"[""Shampoo"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Dining table"", ""Oven"", ""Hangers"", ""Washer"", ""Bed linens"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Hot water"", ""Wifi"", ""Kitchen"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Single level home"", ""Stove"", ""Essentials"", ""Microwave"", ""Heating"", ""High chair"", ""Private entrance"", ""Children\u2019s books and toys"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Free street parking""]",$140.00,2,1125,2,3,1125,1125,2.1,1125.0,,t,19,44,74,349,2022-09-21,27,12,0,2019-07-03,2022-08-20,4.52,4.59,4.41,4.56,4.56,4.78,4.37,,t,1,1,0,0,0.69

Our roots lay in Bruges, we studied in Antwerp, but Ghent touched our soul! So we decided to create our home here! Trough the years we traveled a lot and saw a lot of fantastic places. Raised by parents who have their own B&B learned us how interesting it is to meet people from around the world. It inspired us to do what we love the most: creating nice places and hosting people who want to discover the city as a real local. We create places how we would want it to be as guests. Interior, design and coziness was our hobby but became our passion, and eventually our goal in life.

 I’m an easy-going and caring guy who loves to meet new people. I love traveling the world while using Airbnb to stay everywhere. This gave me the amazing idea to start Airbnb'ing my own unique house in the center of Ghent, on the Vrijdagsmarkt. 

I have a passion for History (hence my interest in our Unesco-listed historical building), books, spirituality, and making music. To be more specific, I make ambient meditation music and give sound healings to help people in the process of Spiritual Awakening. So I love having deep conversations with wonderful souls. You’ll find me sporting, doing yoga, or meditating on a daily basis!

During your city trip, don't miss the opportunity to admire the world-famous masterpiece The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb, by the Van Eyck brothers.<br /><br />Stroll through Ghent's city center and you will immediately understand the many tourist prizes and international praise. Nowhere else can you flash from the 14th to the 21st century (and back!), so quickly without even having the feeling that something is not right. According to the National Geographic Traveler Magazine, Ghent is the most authentic historical city in the world that is bustling with life.<br /><br />Close to the beautiful castle of Gravensteen, you board a boat that will take you along the most beautiful places in Ghent.

I am Vincent, since many years living in the very centre of Ghent. I enjoy delicious drinks and finger licking food, a night in or out with friends, an occasional run, hiking trips and tunes from around the globe.
Like many others, i also love to travel, basically anywhere. Up to now i have mostly enjoyed the hospitality of others during our travels. But, a while ago an opportunity presented itself for me to open up my own holiday place and i just grabbed it. I am super excited to present my unique holiday home and to welcome all kinds of people regardless of colour, gender, sexual orientation or religion, to come and stay over while exploring the lovely city of Ghent.
I have lived and worked in Ghent for many, many years, know where to find hidden gems and so have quite some tips & tricks for visitors.
I hope to welcome you soon and help make your visit to Ghent unforgettable!
